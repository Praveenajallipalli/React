- What is the difference the between Angular and React?
    - React is a library (There are react based frameworks)
    - Angular is a developers platform and framework
- What is the difference between library and framework?
    - web application → designed using library → page loads into browser → loads static DOM → loads library → library is passive → browser uses events to make library active → static DOM is converted into dynamic DOM

    - libraries can build the application but cannot control the flow of application.
    - If we have framework in technology we can use react (it is a library). It is for building user interface but cannot control the flow of application.
    - If we do not have framework in technology we can use angular, as it is a framework.
    - web application → designed using framework →page loads into browser → loads static DOM → loads framework → framework is active → static DOM is converted into dynamic DOM.
    - library can build the application, framework can build and control the application.

- Here JQuery is JavaScript library, here if we write name in browser, it is not displayed in “#msg” because library is not active.

- we need event to make library active.

- framework can easily build the application and control the flow.
- here event handling and functions are not required. angular has inbuilt framework called mvc framework.

- what is react?
    - react is a JavaScript library for building UI.
    - In react, UI is SPA.
    - react can give unified and fluid user experience.
    - It is loosely coupled and extensible architecture.
    - react is used with extra frameworks.
- What are the features of react?
    - It is component based.
        - easy to build interfaces and easy to reuse,
        - building faster,
        - easy to extend,
        - loosely coupled.
    - It uses modular library : does not require full library if we want to use one specific component.
        - application specific library,
        - improves the performance of application (it loads only what is needed for there),
        - light weight application.
    - Asynchronous library
        - Implicitly uses ajax,
        - without reloading complete page new details are added to page
    - React uses virtual DOM
- What is DOM?
- How DOM renders?
- What is shadow DOM?
- What is virtual DOM?
- Difference between DOM, shadow DOM, virtual DOM?
